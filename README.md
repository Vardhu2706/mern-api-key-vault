Design Document for MERN API Key Vault
1. Introduction

The MERN API Key Vault is a secure application designed to manage and store API keys. It leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) to provide a robust solution for handling sensitive information.
2. Architecture Overview

The application follows the typical MERN stack architecture:

    MongoDB: Database for storing API keys and user data.
    Express.js: Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
    React.js: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
    Node.js: Runtime environment for executing server-side JavaScript code.

3. Components
3.1 Frontend

    React Components: The UI is built using React components.
        App.js: Main entry point of the React application.
        Dashboard.js: Displays user-specific API keys.
        Login.js and Register.js: Handle user authentication.
        KeyForm.js: Form for adding new API keys.
    State Management: Uses React's Context API or Redux for state management.
    Styling: CSS or styled-components for styling the application.

3.2 Backend

    Express Server: Handles API requests and serves the frontend.
        server.js: Main entry point for the server.
        routes/keys.js: Routes for CRUD operations on API keys.
        routes/auth.js: Routes for user authentication.
    Controllers: Logic for handling requests.
        keyController.js: Functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting API keys.
        authController.js: Functions for user registration and login.
    Middleware: Custom middleware for authentication and error handling.
        authMiddleware.js: Protects routes that require authentication.
    Database Models: Mongoose schemas and models.
        User.js: Schema for user data.
        Key.js: Schema for API key data.

4. Data Flow

    User Registration/Login:
        User registers or logs in through the frontend.
        Credentials are sent to the backend, which verifies them and returns a JWT token.
        The token is stored in the client's local storage or cookies for subsequent requests.

    API Key Management:
        Authenticated user requests are sent to the backend with the JWT token.
        The backend validates the token and processes CRUD operations on API keys.
        Responses are sent back to the frontend and the UI is updated accordingly.

5. Security Considerations

    Authentication: Uses JWT tokens for user authentication.
    Data Encryption: Sensitive data (API keys) should be encrypted before storing in the database.
    Environment Variables: Secrets (e.g., database URI, JWT secret) are stored in environment variables.
    HTTPS: The application should be served over HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.

6. Deployment

    Frontend: Can be deployed on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
    Backend: Can be deployed on platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
    Database: MongoDB Atlas for a managed cloud database service.

7. Conclusion

The MERN API Key Vault provides a secure and efficient way to manage API keys using the MERN stack. By following best practices for security and deployment, it ensures that sensitive information is handled safely and efficiently.
